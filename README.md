Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

# Milestone 1

Milestone one is about connection of VsCode to the gitHub

# Milestone 2

Code in milestone_2.py creates a list of 5 character vectors. In the first part of the program, we randomly select the list element and show it in the command prompt. The random selection is performed by using the random package. 

The second part of the code demonstrates a method of interaction with the user by using the "while true" statement. It allows the rejection of incorrect inputs and asks a user to try again. Here, we check the user's input to be a single character. 
# Milestone 3

The code in milestone_3.py separate functions of asking and checking the user input on one side and checking if the letter that the user guessed belongs to the randomly selected word from the list.
